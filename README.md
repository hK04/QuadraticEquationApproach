# QuadraticEquationApproach
First approach to developing at University

This program meant to solve polymoial equations with form of $ax^2 + bx^2 + c = 0$

`main.cpp` - C program that solves the equation 

`equation.hpp` - includes functions of input, output, finding of discriminant and solving the equation

`headers.hpp` - includes prototypes of functions and constants
