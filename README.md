# QuadraticEquationApproach
First approach to developing at University

This program meant to solve polymoial equations with form of $ax^2 + bx^2 + c = 0$

`main.cpp` - C program that solves the equation 

`equation.cpp` - includes functions of input, output, finding of discriminant and solving the equation

`equation.hpp` - prototypes of functions

`headers.hpp` - includes structures and constants

# To compile 
open bash -> `g++ main.cpp equation.hpp equation.cpp headers.hpp -o main.o`
